# Kontakt Version Manager

This small exe simply swaps out program files with alternate versions that it keeps in a user specified store.  This way, you can change the version of Kontakt you are using without manually having to swap out the files.  This program requires administrator permissions as it is changing files in the program files folder.  It is Windows only.

If you already have a collection of Kontakt exe, vst3 and/or aax files for this purpose, put them all in a folder and reference that folder in this software.

Everytime you install a new version or update of Kontakt, this software will store that version for you when you press the store button for future loading.
type in the version you want to load and hit the load button to load the version you want to use

You can also check what version is currently loaded with the read button.  This button only works after load or store have been used as it reports back the last usage of load or store for each type (exe,vst,aax)
